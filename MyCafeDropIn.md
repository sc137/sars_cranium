# Cranium Cafe and SARS Anywhere Integration Walkthrough

## Adding DROP-INS from My Cafe

An online counselor can have Express appointments (aka DROP-INS) that are during scheduled hours. DROP-IN appointments will be recorded to SARS Anywhere in the DROP-INS tab. Counselors can add Reason Codes and notes directly from their My Cafe.

Counselors must login to their Cafe by going to the [Rio Hondo Cranium Cafe](riohondo.craniumcafe.com) URL and then selecting Enter My Cafe.

Students who would like an Express appointment will need to visit the [Online Counseling lobby](https://riohondo.craniumcafe.com/group/online-counseling/lobby) URL and sign-in using the Auto Login button.

They will sign-in with their Access Rio credentials. These are the same as they use to access Canvas.

Students may see a list of available Reason Codes to choose from for their meeting. This may change in the future to default to "EXPRESS" pending a future update (2017-03-08).
