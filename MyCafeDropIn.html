<p>An online counselor can have Express appointments (aka DROP-INS) that are during scheduled hours. DROP-IN appointments will be recorded to SARS Anywhere in the DROP-INS tab. Counselors can add Reason Codes and notes directly from their My Cafe.</p>
<p>Counselors must login to their Cafe by going to the <a href="riohondo.craniumcafe.com">Rio Hondo Cranium Cafe</a> URL and then selecting Enter My Cafe.</p>
<pre><code>https://riohondo.craniumcafe.com/</code></pre>
<p>Students who would like an Express appointment will need to visit the <a href="https://riohondo.craniumcafe.com/group/online-counseling/lobby">Online Counseling lobby</a> URL and sign-in using the Auto Login button.</p>
